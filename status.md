I now have a user document working roughly as I envision it will. It is still lacking in methods and at some point will likely need to be differentiated between public and user versions.

Ideas for what to work on next (not necessarily in order):
1. Create a list of methods and document what's done and what's not
2. Implement the client library
3. Create a fake user account and allow switching between it and the main account rather easily. I'm thinking this will require changes to the organization of the config.
4. Update the ReadMe
