## Journal Name Normalization ##
Journals names can vary slightly, making it difficult to compare them. For all journal articles, ISSN values should be obtained. Additionally, to help with filtering when ISSN is not available, a standard journal name should be resolved. I believe that Pubmed has this information. It should be worked into PyPub.
